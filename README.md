Website Title: HYBE Boy Group Guidebook

We, Nix and MJ, plan to create a site that consists of all the boy groups under a label called HYBE. We are both huge fans of kpop idols and bonded over it upon meeting each other for the first time. We want to be able to share our love of kpop with others and help others bond over their favorite boy groups from the entertainment company, HYBE. 

Each of the web pages will contain information on and related to the boy groups under the HYBE Entertainment Label. The webpage will contain the following pages: 

1. Home Page/Landing Page - This page will have links to all the subpages of the site. It will have a brief description of the history of the BigHit label and how it came to be.

2. BTS Page - This page will be about BTS, the worldwide boy group. It will contain information about their members, how the group was formed, their latest discography, and some of their biggest milestones. 


3. TXT Page - This page will be about TXT, a four-member boy group whose acronym stands for Tomorrow X Together. It will contain information about their members, how the group was formed, their latest discography, and some of their biggest milestones.

4. ENHYPEN Page - This page will be about ENHYPEN, the group that aims to connect, grow, and discover each other. It will contain information about their members, how the group was formed, their latest discography, and some of their biggest milestones. 

5. Seventeen Page - This page will be about Seventeen, a self-producing idol group. It will contain information about their members, how the group was formed, their latest discography, and some of their biggest milestones.
